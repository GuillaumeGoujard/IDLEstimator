 The following are the two ways to specify that the target MAPE should be 41.1:

 ``-t 41.1``

 If this option is not given, the target MAPE is the MAPE based on the input data.
|
* **--simulated_timeseries TEXT**:
 If the user wants to simulate actuals from forecasts, then the simulated timeseries will be "actuals".
 On the other hands, if the user wants to simulate forecasts from actuals, then the simulated timeseries

 so the forecast errors are correlated.

 If this option is not given, the base process is assumed to be "ARMA"
|
* **--a FLOAT**:

 a% of data on the left and a% on the right is used.

 The following are the two ways to specify that the percent of data is 4.3:

 ``--a 4.3``

 ``-a 4.3``

 If this option is not given, the percent of data on the left and on the right for the estimation is assumed to be 4.

 ``-sd "2020-1-3 00:00:00"``

.. note:: The user need to set both "simulation_start_dt" and "simulation_end_dt".
 If this option is not given, then it will use "input_start_dt" as the simulation start date.
 If "input_start_dt" is None, then it will use the first date of the input file as the simulation start date.
 The "simulation_start_dt" must be on or after the input start date for the simulations.
|
* **--simulation_end_dt TEXT**:
 The end date of the simulation of scenarios, must be between the input file date range. (format = "Y-m-d H:M:S")

* **--load_pickle**:

 This will load the pickle file for the data set instead of estimating the parameters for the conditional beta distribution.
 Every run will create the pickle file or update the existing pickle file for that dataset containing
 the parameters for conditional beta distribution in the stored_vectors subdirectory in the utilities directory.
 This command can be used to call the pickle file containing the values for the parameters for the same subset of the dataset
 as the last run to compute the same `simulated_timeseries` as the preceding command(s) for that data file.
